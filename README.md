# ShortestPathAlgorithms
This project aims to compare the performance of two different algorithms, Dijkstra's Algorithm and Floyd's Algorithm, in finding the shortest path between any two nodes. Additionally, it compares the efficiency of two different data structures, Linked List and 2D Arrays, in storing and accessing the data.

Objective
The objectives of this project are as follows:

Algorithm Performance Comparison: Compare the performance of Dijkstra's Algorithm and Floyd's Algorithm in finding the shortest path between any two nodes.
Data Structures Performance Comparison: Compare the memory usage and efficiency of Linked List and 2D Arrays as data structures for this project.
Algorithms Used
Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the shortest path between two given nodes in a graph. It requires a source node as the starting point and iteratively finds the shortest path to all other nodes in the graph.

Floyd's Algorithm
Floyd's Algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to find the shortest path between any two given nodes in a graph. It computes the pair-wise shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the graph.

Analysis
Data Structure Comparison
In this project, Linked List and 2D Arrays were used as data structures to store and represent the city map.

Linked List: Linked List takes more memory compared to 2D Arrays as it requires storing references to the next node along with the data. However, when it comes to efficiency in terms of time, Linked List shows slightly better performance.
2D Arrays: 2D Arrays are more memory-efficient as they store data in a contiguous block of memory. However, they may require more time for certain operations compared to Linked List.
Algorithm Comparison
The comparison between Dijkstra's Algorithm and Floyd's Algorithm yields the following observations:

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Dijkstra's Algorithm demonstrates both time and memory efficiency compared to Floyd's Algorithm. It is particularly efficient in finding the shortest path from a given source node to all other nodes in the graph.
Floyd's Algorithm: Floyd's Algorithm, being a pair-wise shortest path algorithm, may have higher time and memory requirements compared to Dijkstra's Algorithm. However, it can find the shortest path between any two given nodes in the graph.
